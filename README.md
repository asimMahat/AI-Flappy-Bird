# AI-Flappy-BIrd
Here, flappy bird learns to play the game by itself using NEAT(Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies) algorithm.

This is build by using python pygame library. 
The basic overview of the process:
1. Importing the necessary libraries.
2. Loading the data(images).
3. Creating classes 'Pipe','Bird','Base' and defining multiple functions.
4. Defining the function def draw_window to draw the window for game.
5. The 'def main()' function is used to call the necessary attributes.
6. The 'def run()' function is used to run the config file. The config file is where we set the values
   for popualtion size, generation,fitness threshold,activation function as so on.
7. Finally the config file is loaded to config_path and config_path is being run.
